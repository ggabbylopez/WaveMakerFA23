When checked, record analytics will cause the motors to output additional 
information during runtime. This information will be outputted to an analytics
 file with the date of the run.

Analytics from multiple runs on the same day will be in the same file, but
 will be clearly separated.
    
This can only be done when the motors are run continuously.
        
NOTE: Since this information is pulled during runtime, the motors will appear
unresponsive, and can't be stopped (right now) while information is being 
collected.
